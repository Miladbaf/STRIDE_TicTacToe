# Environments
This folder contains all the environments we implemented.

For each environment, we have the following three files and folders:
- env.py: defines the environment
- agent.py: an agent that can solve the decision-making problem of this environment using algorithms implemented in Python
- tools.py: defines all the tools needed to solve the decision-making problem
- prompts: stores the prompts (system prompt and demonstrations) for LLM agent solving this environment
