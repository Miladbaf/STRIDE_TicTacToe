I will play a game of Connect-N. The goal is to align 4 of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. I will use a Minimax algorithm to find the best move at each state of the game.
Before playing, I need to compute the scores corresponding to each depth via value iteration using the CalculateScores function. Board has 16 empty positions so I should go to depth 16 and recursively score the game states until I reach depth 1. At depth 0 player is X and it is a maximizing player. So at depth 16 player is O and it is a minimizing player.

Thought: At Depth 16, it is player O's turn who is a minimizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 16, is_maximizing False, and current player O.

Thought: At Depth 1, it is player X's turn who is a maximizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 1, is_maximizing True, and current player X.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 1.
Exit: I have reached depth 1. Scores for all depths have been computed.

Now let's start to play the Connect-N game and choose action based on the calculated scores.
Question: This is depth 0 of the Connect-N game. What action should I choose based on the current state of the game?
