I will play a game of Connect-N. The goal is to align 3 of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. I will use a Minimax algorithm to find the best move at each state of the game.
Before playing, I need to compute the scores corresponding to each depth via value iteration using the CalculateScores function. Board has 9 empty positions so I should go to depth 9 and recursively score the game states until I reach depth 1. At depth 0 player is X and it is a maximizing player. So at depth 9 player is X and it is a maximizing player.

Thought: At Depth 9, it is player X's turn who is a maximizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 9, is_maximizing True, and current player X.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 9.
Thought: At Depth 8, it is player O's turn who is a minimizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 8, is_maximizing False, and current player O.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 8.
Thought: At Depth 7, it is player X's turn who is a maximizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 7, is_maximizing True, and current player X.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 7.
Thought: At Depth 6, it is player O's turn who is a minimizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 6, is_maximizing False, and current player O.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 6.
Thought: At Depth 5, it is player X's turn who is a maximizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 5, is_maximizing True, and current player X.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 5.
Thought: At Depth 4, it is player O's turn who is a minimizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 4, is_maximizing False, and current player O.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 4.
Thought: At Depth 3, it is player X's turn who is a maximizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 3, is_maximizing True, and current player X.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 3.
Thought: At Depth 2, it is player O's turn who is a minimizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 2, is_maximizing False, and current player O.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 2.
Thought: At Depth 1, it is player X's turn who is a maximizing player.
Operation: Called function CalculateScores with depth 1, is_maximizing True, and current player X.
Result: Scores calculated at depth 1.
Exit: I have reached depth 1. Scores for all depths have been computed.

Now let's start to play the Connect-N game and choose action based on the calculated scores.
Question: This is depth 0 of the Connect-N game. What action should I choose based on the current state of the game?
Thought: I should first call GetScores to retrieve the scores for each action in depth 1. It is my turn and I am a maximizing player so I should choose the score with maximum score (break the tie randomly if there are multiple maximum scores).
Operation: called function GetScores to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth 1.
Result: The list of scores for all available actions presented as (action,score) pairs is: [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)].
Exit: I am a maximizing player therefore, I should choose action 6.
Board is now: [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'X', None, None]
Question: This is depth 1 of the Connect-N game. What action should I choose based on the current state of the game?
Thought: I should first call GetScores to retrieve the scores for each action in depth 2. It is my turn and I am a minimizing player so I should choose the score with minimum score (break the tie randomly if there are multiple minimum scores).
Operation: called function GetScores to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth 2.
Result: The list of scores for all available actions presented as (action,score) pairs is: [(3, 1), (7, 1), (8, 0)].
Exit: I am a minimizing player therefore, I should choose action 8.
Board is now: [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'X', None, 'O']
Question: This is depth 2 of the Connect-N game. What action should I choose based on the current state of the game?
Thought: I should first call GetScores to retrieve the scores for each action in depth 3. It is my turn and I am a maximizing player so I should choose the score with maximum score (break the tie randomly if there are multiple maximum scores).
Operation: called function GetScores to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth 3.
Result: The list of scores for all available actions presented as (action,score) pairs is: [(3, -1), (7, -1), (5, 0)].
