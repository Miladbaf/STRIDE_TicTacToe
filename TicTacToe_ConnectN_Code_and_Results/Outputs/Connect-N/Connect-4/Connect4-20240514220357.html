I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty 
positions so I should go to depth <span class="r5">16</span> and recursively score the game states until I reach depth <span class="r5">1</span>. At depth <span class="r5">0</span> player is X and it is a maximizing
player. So at depth <span class="r5">16</span> player is O and it is a minimizing player.
Thought: At the last depth <span class="r5">16</span>, the score values simply equal the immediate reward of each state. At Depth <span class="r5">16</span>, it is player O&#x27;s turn who is a 
minimizing player.

Exit: I have reached depth <span class="r5">1</span>. Scores for all depths have been computed.
Now let&#x27;s start to play the ConnectN game and choose action based on the calculated scores.
Question: This is depth <span class="r5">0</span> of the ConnectN game. What action should I choose based on the current state of the game?
Action: Called function GETSCORES to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth <span class="r5">1</span>.

I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty 
positions so I should go to depth <span class="r5">16</span> and recursively score the game states until I reach depth <span class="r5">1</span>. At depth <span class="r5">0</span> player is X and it is a maximizing
player. So at depth <span class="r5">16</span> player is O and it is a minimizing player.
Thought: At the last depth <span class="r5">16</span>, the score values simply equal the immediate reward of each state. At Depth <span class="r5">16</span>, it is player O&#x27;s turn who is a 
minimizing player.

I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty

It seems like we have completed the game by making decisions based on the calculated scores and following the optimal strategy. The game has 
concluded with the result being a tie.

If you have any more tasks or if you want to play another game, feel free to let me know!
Game Over: The result of the game is a tie! If you want to play again or have any other tasks in mind, feel free to let me know.
Exit signal received, stopping interaction.
Now let&#x27;s start to play the ConnectN game and choose action based on the calculated scores.

I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty 
positions so I should go to depth <span class="r5">16</span> and recursively score the game states until I reach depth <span class="r5">1</span>. At depth <span class="r5">0</span> player is X and it is a maximizing
player. So at depth <span class="r5">16</span> player is O and it is a minimizing player.
Thought: At the last depth <span class="r5">16</span>, the score values simply equal the immediate reward of each state. At Depth <span class="r5">16</span>, it is player O&#x27;s turn who is a

I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty

==== USER ====
I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty 
positions so I should go to depth <span class="r5">16</span> and recursively score the game states until I reach depth <span class="r5">1</span>. At depth <span class="r5">0</span> player is X and it is a maximizing
player. So at depth <span class="r5">16</span> player is O and it is a minimizing player.
Thought: At the last depth <span class="r5">16</span>, the score values simply equal the immediate reward of each state. At Depth <span class="r5">16</span>, it is player O&#x27;s turn who is a 
minimizing player.

Exit: I have reached depth <span class="r5">1</span>. Scores for all depths have been computed.
CALCULATESCORES call completed, I should processed with playing the game.
It seems we have completed the calculation of scores at each depth from <span class="r5">1</span> to <span class="r5">91</span>. Now, you can continue playing the Connect-N game utilizing the
computed scores to make informed decisions at each step. Let&#x27;s proceed with the game.
Action: Called function GETSCORES to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth <span class="r5">1</span>.
The list of scores for all available actions presented as <span class="r8">(</span>action,score<span class="r8">)</span> pairs is: <span class="r8">[(</span><span class="r5">10</span>, <span class="r5">0</span><span class="r8">)</span>, <span class="r8">(</span><span class="r5">11</span>, <span class="r5">0</span><span class="r8">)]</span>.
Player X moved to position <span class="r5">11</span>.
Since this is depth <span class="r5">1</span> of the Connect-N game and you are a maximizing player, you should choose the action with the maximum score. In this case,
both available actions have a score of <span class="r5">0</span>. Therefore, you can choose any action randomly. Let&#x27;s go with action <span class="r5">10</span>.
Action: Called function GETSCORES to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth <span class="r5">2</span>.
The list of scores for all available actions presented as <span class="r8">(</span>action,score<span class="r8">)</span> pairs is: <span class="r8">[(</span><span class="r5">6</span>, <span class="r5">0</span><span class="r8">)</span>, <span class="r8">(</span><span class="r5">11</span>, <span class="r5">1</span><span class="r8">)]</span>.
Player O moved to position <span class="r5">7</span>.
Since this is depth <span class="r5">2</span> of the Connect-N game and you are a minimizing player, you should choose the action with the minimum score. In this case,
action <span class="r5">6</span> has a score of <span class="r5">0</span>, and action <span class="r5">11</span> has a score of <span class="r5">1</span>. Therefore, you should choose action <span class="r5">6</span> as it has the lower score.
Action: Called function GETSCORES to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth <span class="r5">3</span>.
The list of scores for all available actions presented as <span class="r8">(</span>action,score<span class="r8">)</span> pairs is: <span class="r8">[(</span><span class="r5">2</span>, <span class="r5">0</span><span class="r8">)</span>, <span class="r8">(</span><span class="r5">11</span>, <span class="r5">-1</span><span class="r8">)]</span>.
Player X moved to position <span class="r5">3</span>.
Since this is depth <span class="r5">3</span> of the Connect-N game and you are a maximizing player, you should choose the action with the maximum score. In this case,
action <span class="r5">2</span> has a score of <span class="r5">0</span>, and action <span class="r5">11</span> has a score of <span class="r5">-1</span>. Therefore, you should choose action <span class="r5">2</span> as it has the higher score.

I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty 
positions so I should go to depth <span class="r5">16</span> and recursively score the game states until I reach depth <span class="r5">1</span>. At depth <span class="r5">0</span> player is X and it is a maximizing
player. So at depth <span class="r5">16</span> player is O and it is a minimizing player.
Thought: At the last depth <span class="r5">16</span>, the score values simply equal the immediate reward of each state. At Depth <span class="r5">16</span>, it is player O&#x27;s turn who is a

I will play a game of ConnectN. The goal is to align three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Board has <span class="r5">16</span> empty 
positions so I should go to depth <span class="r5">16</span> and recursively score the game states until I reach depth <span class="r5">1</span>. At depth <span class="r5">0</span> player is X and it is a maximizing
player. So at depth <span class="r5">16</span> player is O and it is a minimizing player.
Thought: At the last depth <span class="r5">16</span>, the score values simply equal the immediate reward of each state. At Depth <span class="r5">16</span>, it is player O&#x27;s turn who is a 
minimizing player.

The list of scores for all available actions presented as <span class="r8">(</span>action,score<span class="r8">)</span> pairs is: <span class="r8">[(</span><span class="r5">6</span>, <span class="r5">0</span><span class="r8">)]</span>.
Player X moved to position <span class="r5">7</span>.
As a maximizing player at depth <span class="r5">14</span>, I should choose action <span class="r5">6</span>.
It seems we have reached the end of the game as there is only one available action with a score. Let&#x27;s proceed with this action.
Game Over! The result is a tie. Great job in playing the Connect-N game using the calculated scores at each depth. If you would like to play 
again or need any further assistance, feel free to let me know!
Exit signal received, stopping interaction.
Now let&#x27;s start to play the ConnectN game and choose action based on the calculated scores.
Question: This is depth <span class="r5">15</span> of the ConnectN game. What action should I choose based on the current state of the game?
Action: Called function GETSCORES to retrieve the scores for all actions at the current state and depth <span class="r5">15</span>.
The list of scores for all available actions presented as <span class="r8">(</span>action,score<span class="r8">)</span> pairs is: <span class="r8">[(</span><span class="r5">2</span>, <span class="r5">0</span><span class="r8">)]</span>.
Player O moved to position <span class="r5">3</span>.
Board is: <span class="r8">[</span><span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span>, <span class="r3">&#x27;X&#x27;</span><span class="r8">]</span>
Over: Game is over and the result is a tie! I should exit the program.
